# ceci-est-un-pipeau

This repo will be used for our upcoming contest. This file contains organisation information.

## Environment Setup

It may take quite a while to install some packages. To save time, it is preferable to do this before the contest.

### [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) (Recommended)

Anaconda comes with a lot of useful libraries and environment management tools. It's easy to set up.

### virtualenv


[Here](http://www.jontourage.com/2011/02/09/virtualenv-pip-basics/) is a tutorial of virtualenv. Use ```requirements.txt``` (non existing) in the repo to set up.

## Strategies

- Greedy
- CP + NEOS
- Iterative Optimisation
- Approximation


## TODO
- make requirements.txt
- NEOS utilities
